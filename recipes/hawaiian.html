    <h1>Hawaiian Pizza</h1>
    <img src="https://sushisumo.ru/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/й3.jpg">
    <p>Hawaiian pizza is a pizza originating in Canada, and is traditionally topped with pineapple, tomato sauce, cheese, and either ham or bacon.</p>
    <p>Sam Panopoulos, a Greek-born Canadian, created the first Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1962. Inspired in part by his experience preparing Chinese dishes which commonly mix sweet and savory flavours, Panopoulos experimented with adding pineapple, ham, bacon, and other toppings. These additions were not initially very popular.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough - 400 g</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce - 2 table spoons</li>
        <li>Ham/Bacon - 100 g</li>
        <li>Mozarella - 150 g</li>
        <li>Olive oil - 1 table spoon</li>
        <li>Pineaplle - 100 g</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare pizza dough, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.</li>
        <li>To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with pizza sauce, then add the cheese, ham, pineapple, and bacon.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil, if desired. Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
